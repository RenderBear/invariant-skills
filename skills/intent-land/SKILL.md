# intent-land

Landing is one convergence operation. It does not invent governance.

Normal repository work lands from `intent/work/<uuid>` through `merge`; `direct` is only valid for
the first commit on an unborn integration branch. Keep the integration worktree clean. A linked
worker worktree is recommended but only coordinated work requires a plan and leases.

Recompute reach against the exact candidate. Run all emitted contract and constraint verifiers.
Semantically review every affected constraint against the candidate and pass its
`--reviewed constraint:<id>` acknowledgement. Under `resolution: assisted`, ask only when the
candidate conflicts with or changes accepted meaning; under `auto`, resolve within request
authority. Removing or rewriting accepted governance remains gated.

Use `scripts/land-support.sh direct|merge`. Pass every unit, derived scope, selected semantic
domain, explicitly claimed governance item, repository check, and runtime plan id. Pass exactly one
`--boundary-review`: `no-record`, `audit:<id>`, or `recorded`. `recorded` requires one or more
`--governance` references. The script validates audit freshness and rejects audits with adoptable or
unresolved findings, then preserves the disposition and references as `Intent-Boundary` and
`Intent-Governance` trailers. A coordinated landing must have matching fresh leases; the script
validates their branch, target, and combined path/domain/governance coverage.

The script constructs a dangling candidate, validates intent and trailers in a detached worktree,
runs checks against that exact tree, and compare-and-swaps the integration ref. Conflict, failed
verification, missing semantic review, stale or mismatched lease, changed target, or unresolved
governance leaves the ref unchanged.

After landing, give a short decision-oriented report: durable meaning changed, governance merely
reviewed, unique checks run, landing or divergence result, and anything intentionally unresolved.
Omit empty categories, use human language before identifiers, and do not replay the complete reach
output.

`TOPOLOGY-NEW` output means the candidate introduced a mechanical area or package scope absent from
the integration tree. Treat it as a prompt to recheck durable meaning, never as evidence that the
scope is a semantic domain or requires governance by itself.

Use [references/conflict-resolution.md](references/conflict-resolution.md) for actual Git conflicts.
Local landing follows from an implementation request. Push, deployment, publication, destructive
cleanup, and other external effects require explicit request authority.
